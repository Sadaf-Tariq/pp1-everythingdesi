# About everything DESI
The everything DESI website is a catering website for anyone who loves desi food. When deciding on a topic for the project. I wanted to do something I am passionate about. I love desi food and I love to cook, and catering service is something I want to do in the future so I concluded to do a catering website. The website offers spicy, rich, flavourful, and diverse desi cuisine.

Users of this website will be able to find all the information they need to know about everything DESI website: About the kitchen, specialty, full menu, the service gallery, contact information, and an enquiry form. This site is targeted towards people who love to eat desi food and wants a reliable catering service to cater their events.
